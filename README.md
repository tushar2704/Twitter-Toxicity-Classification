# Twitter Toxicity Classification

This project aims to solve the problem of identifying the toxicity of tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Given the dataset `twitter_parsed_tweets`, we will implement a step-by-step NLP approach to classify tweets into binary values based on their toxicity.

## Problem Statement

In this project, we will tackle the task of toxicity classification for tweets. The main objective is to develop a model that can accurately identify toxic tweets and assign them a binary value indicating their toxicity level. The classification will enable us to flag potentially harmful content on social media platforms and take appropriate actions.

## Dataset

The dataset `twitter_parsed_tweets` contains a collection of tweets along with their corresponding annotations. It consists of the following columns:

- `index`: Index of the tweet
- `id`: Unique identifier for each tweet
- `Text`: The text content of the tweet
- `Annotation`: Annotation indicating the toxicity level of the tweet
- `oh_label`: Binary label indicating the toxicity (1 for toxic, 0 for non-toxic)

## Approach

The NLP approach to toxicity classification involves several key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: We will perform data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess the text data for further analysis.

2. **Text Preprocessing**: In this step, we will apply techniques such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and normalizing the text to prepare it for feature extraction.

3. **Feature Extraction**: We will extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data. This may involve methods such as creating a bag-of-words representation, using TF-IDF, or utilizing word embeddings.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: We will train a machine learning model, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or a deep learning model like LSTM or BERT, on the extracted features. The model will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques like cross-validation.

5. **Model Deployment**: Once a satisfactory model is obtained, it can be deployed to classify new, unseen tweets and provide toxicity predictions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tushar2704/twitter-toxicity-classification.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify new tweets by calling the relevant functions or scripts.
